# Printstagram

A website based on a LAMP stack that I built for a databases course.  Note that the project was not concerned with the design of the website beyond basic UI, so I just used bootstrap to achieve basic functionality.

Designed the mySQL database given a spec so that information could be stored correctly and efficiently. Received 98.7% for the project, and an A for the course.

The idea behind the project was to create a version of Instagram that has stronger privacy measures (implementing things like friend groups, permissions etc).
